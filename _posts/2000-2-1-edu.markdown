* __2018 - 2020__
* During my master's program in radiochemistry, I specialized in computational methods. My research involved a combination of chemoinformatics tools and quantum chemistry techniques. As a result, we were able to identify potential inhibitors of AT1R, which could serve as both therapeutic agents and positron emission tomographic (PET) radiopharmaceuticals. To further enhance their efficacy, we labeled these compounds with F18.
